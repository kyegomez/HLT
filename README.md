# Humanoid Locomotion Transformer
This is an implementation of the robotic transformer for humanoid robots from the premier paper from berkely: "Real-World Humanoid Locomotion with Reinforcement Learning". Here we implement the state policy model which is an MLP/FFN and a Transformer model that intakes both history and action tokens to output the next action sequence.
